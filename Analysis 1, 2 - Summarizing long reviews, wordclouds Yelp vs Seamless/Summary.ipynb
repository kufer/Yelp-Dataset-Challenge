      "My girlfriend and I ate here in 2012. We both took violently I'll within 12 hours. We alerted the manager in person, via phone call from both of us and in writing via email. Their response was one of denial, lack of empathy and a complete disregard for customer service. We notified them not to finger point but out of public health concern and Casey the manager was put off by this. She stated do what you need to do to make yourself feel better. I caution you to eat here, they may make you sick. They don't care about their customers,  suggest try another steak place.\n",

      "I LOVE THIS PIZZA!! Im usually very picky with pizza since I am not a big fan of the marinara sauce, but let me tell you...SOOOO GOOOD!. I usually order spinach and broccoli, which at first I was kinda unsure since Ive never had it in pizza. I can say that it has been made my number one all time fav. Now everywhere I go I ask for it ( eventhough they dont compare). The staff there is always very nice and curteous. They tend to get prettty busy around lunch time since the hospital and other medical offices are in the surrounding area.\n",

      "We stumbled upon this place at Planet Hollywood one Sunday evening after not getting into a show (thanks a lot Trader Vic's!) and vowed to come back and try it. So while most people are enjoying family dinner's Christmas eve, we decided to walk the strip and headed back to this place for some grub. The menu looks very vanilla. However, our sandwiches were anything but ordinary. Husband got holiday special which was like Thanksgiving dinner with all the fixings on their bread. I got The Earl's Club and had a When Harry Met Sally moment eating this sandwich. So freaking good--and I KNOW turkey sandwiches. I think the most amazing part is their bread. It looks all white and doughy before it goes in and then when you get your sandwich it has been perfectly toasted and is scrumptious. \n",
      "We actually took some friend's back there the weekend after Christmas for a repeat performance. And a repeat it was... so good. \n",

I typically only order food that I cannot make at home, but tonight I went with the mashed red potatoes, broccoli and chicken cutlet dinner. Not bad and tasted about how I would make it at home, haha. But, let me tell you about the cheesecake I had. The red velvet cheesecake cake. WOW.

      "The only reason I'm giving this place even one star is because the food was pretty decent for a buffet. However, the service was absolutely horrendous. Starting from the rude cashiers all the way to management. Don't forget to tip before the horrible service, or they will rain fire on your table. God forbid, you leave a tip at the end of your meal where you serve yourself. Not only did our server slam our drinks down and ignore us the whole time, except to give our whole table an evil stare down, but she refused to give us refills on our inclusive champagne brunch. She even said we couldn't get refills on our iced teas, oj's, or sodas.... I thought this was a buffet. Luckily she brought the manager over and they had an argument about refills in front of us because our server wanted us to see it. Whatever that means. When we asked her if something was wrong, she went on a rant about how only god can judge her and then things turned from bad to worse. I guess that God justifies bad service, rudeness, and denies us new silverware. But in a turn of fate, after being open about our concerns, she gave our table all of her attention before leaving in the middle of our meal. After she left, our new server didn't even look at our table, introduce herself, clear off plates, or anything that has to Do with good service. But we tracked her down on the other side of the restaurant and got some refills. I would like to think that maybe they just hate us, but we were not the only ones who were yelled at or ignored. Clearly customer service is not a priority. The management here obviously  doesn't want people coming back, seeing as how rude they were. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who is looking for an easy going meal. But the food is good... So I guess that counts for something. Maybe.\n",

      "First i got some wings cause i am addicted to hot wings.  They were not the very best i have had but they were good.  The wings were nice and meaty with the right amount of sauce.  My double bacon cheeseburger was very good but they were frozen patties just cooked on the grill.  I got deep fried mushrooms instead of fries which were cooked very well but kind of small.  The bloody gary was excellent but expensive for just one cause it had alot of ice in the glass.  Its called a bloody gary because its garys recipe.  The drink has beef broth in it which gives it a different taste.  Overall i enjoyed the meal but kind of expensive.

      "Beto's is one of the childhood memories I'm most fondest of. I remember dear old dad and me getting in the car, driving to Banksville road and getting a few slices. I remember that crusty bottom crust, the simple sauce of just tomatoes, the cool cheese on the top, and gooey cheese closer to the hot crust. This is a unique pizza. You get crunchy, chewy, warm, and cool in each bite. Now if you take it home the cheese will melt,(by the way this is the best cold breakfast pizza you'll ever have!) but if you do like locals do, you'll eat it there and enjoy it the way it's supposed to be eaten. The bread fresh from the oven, cold, full fat mozzarella spread on top. Then when you order a slice or two, some very nice Beto pizza chef with a heavy hand will put at least a quarter pound of cheese on each slice. I must get to Beto's soon and have a slice or two and think back to childhood memories and dad.\n",

This is great if you happen to be an omnivore. Which I am not. I can only say anything about the Madison Square Garden which I have had three times now. Their veggies seem to be of good quality. I just wish that every time I came in they were not out of wheat bread. I don't know if they just don't stock up on it or what but every time I have been in here they have been out of something. Cucumbers, wheat bread, avocado. And usually there is never any black tea. Some people like to ATTEMPT to eat healthy. There is also a lot left to be desired if you do order any of the other sandwiches on the menu. I went with my dad the last time who happens to eat meat, and there was more bread than meat. 10 dollars for a bread and cheese sandwich. Come on now. You have pictures all over the place of sandwiches full to the brim with meat and veggies, but then hand you a sandwich that you can't even see the meat on. FALSE ADVERTISING.

      "Not usually a fan of buffets, but this one was a winner in my book. Clean dining room, attentive server, excellent selection of food to choose from.  My favorite was the beef with broccoli, from the Asian cuisine section.  All of the meat was quality steak, with none of the chewy, grisly bits you would find at a cheaper restaurant.  The sushi, chicken and apple sausage with sauerkraut, and taco bar were also good. The dessert bar was nice, and there was even a sugar-free section, for those who are into that type of thing.  Bottom line: the food is good, and as long as you're going to eat 3+ plates of food (for $40) it is definitely worth it.\n",

      "I've moved back to Champaign-Urbana after living here briefly 8 years ago and sooo much has changed. I feel like either the town finally realized that it would be wise to start spiffing its image up a bit to attract more students' $$  by spending some $$ or else maybe in the last 8 years, CU's been adopted by a millionaire benefactor with desire to see a small town emulate a big bad city in its gastric offerings. The restaurant scene here has improved phenomenally. My boyfriend and I popped into Radio Maria after being turned away from Bacaro for not having a reservation on a Saturday night. We both had to giggle a little as that's never happened to either of us before in Chicago but it's good to get rejected every now and then. The waitress was apologetic and nice enough about it. So next door to Radio it was and I'm so glad we gave it a chance. We hadn't been in the mood for tapas until we opened the menu. Surprisingly innovative, interesting and very hip. We tried the smoked red potatoes with aioli, the fire roasted pears with manchego shavings and fennel, spanish fusilli pasta salad with olives (which I didn't want to fuss with at first b/c I hate spitting out seeds in public but they were pitted, nice touch) and spanish olive oil. I'm not a big dessert person but since I'd been enjoying the meal so much, I splurged and ordered the pumpkin cheesecake with cinnamon cream sauce. Still thinking about it a day later...the restaurant's decor was again surprisingly hip for Champaign. The bar is lit in blue from beneath and the artwork was very urban/Japanese. There was this cool light box banner thing running the length of the artfully splash-painted brick walls that I'd love to have in our house back in Chicago. Check it out if you're in town. The waitstaff and service was also very friendly, young and attentive.\n",

      "I've been to NoRTH and Bar NoRTH many times, but this time was just totally disappointing.  Just to put things in perspective, we were there for a late lunch (after 2pm) on a Friday.  We walked in and they told us to take any seat.  Then we waited over 10 minutes before anyone came with menus.  It wasn't as if they didn't see us walk in.  We ordered a salad and a pizza, and we were splitting both.  The salad came and they had already split it for us - nice touch.  Then we waited 40 minutes for the pizza.  Crazy.  Of course, the waiter came right away with the bill, but then never showed up to take my credit card.  We walked up to the bar to pay on our way out.  I'm not sure if I'll be real anxious about giving them another try - if they can't handle the meals when it's empty, what'll it be like when it's busy?!?\n",

This place was AMAZING. It is on the pricey side, but definitely worth a trip a few times a year. The portions are small, and the atmosphere is very quaint. The service is top notch!!! Everyone is very friendly, and there is not as much fakeness as one may find elsewhere on the strip in Vegas.\n",

Almost 50 different types of sandwiches available to choose from. Staff is always friendly and are gracious for the business. Even if a Subway or Quizino's was in the area, this would still be my choice. About 15 tables available to sit in and they also over large subs for catering! It's even open on Sunday's from 11am-4pm, which is great, as it's hard to find a sandwich place on Sunday's open.\n",

      "Bacaro is a restaurant that I would reserve for a special occasion....or just to treat yourself to something a little different.  My favorite is the Market Monday prix fixe menu with ingredients selected from the saturday farmers market.  to go from fresh local ingredients on saturday morning to a full 5 course meal and wine pairings by monday night is pretty spectacular.  The last couple market night meals that i have been to have been around 40 dollars, and for an additional 25, you can get some awesome wines (highly recommended). The courses are so elegantly prepared with amazing presentation and you won't go home hungry.  I've noticed the dishes are a little too salty for my taste... actually, they're consistently salty to me (but then again this is coming from someone who barely ever salts their food) but i think you can get around it by indulging less in the amazing sauces.  and the desserts-- so delicious.  the desserts truly capture the seasons and the feel of the weather so perfectly.  I honestly don't know a better way to start the week!  if you have a bad case of the mondays, treat yourself to some bacaro.  and your spirits will be lifted. \n",

      "I have gone several times and enjoyed several of the menu items, and a few market nights (i hear they're introducing an occasional VEGETARIAN!!!! market menu!!) and i have never been disappointed.  The service is great, and they are very attentive.  Some servers are more knowledgeable about the wines and others know a little more about the food and preparation, but overall, they are a pleasant and fun to talk to group.  If you ask them a question and they don't know the answer, they are probably equally curious to know the answer as well-- meaning they will find you an answer even if it means hounding the chef :-) \n",

      "\n",
      "Burgers: So far I've tried the Miyagi, Kalbi, and Bahn-Mi burgers. And for the most part, flavor profiles are retained throughout the various cuisines. The Kalbi burger evokes Korean BBQ and Kimchi, and the Bahn-Mi burger tastes like the sandwich. What makes the burger special, however, is the texture profile. Unlike Umami burger, there is a light crunch on the outside due to a combination of caramelization and maillard, the same found on top-end steaks. Doneness is perfect and the burger balances texture and moisture, rather than having the patty soak into the bun.\n",

      "Cookie Monster coined a term that would accurately describe my feelings about my lunch here - Nomnomnomnom! I had the prime rib French dip with mixed fries. VERY tasty! The prime was just that - prime. The side of horseradish cream was not crazy spicy, just enough to add a nice little zing to the sandwich. And why haven't more restaurants thought of offering mixed fries? A nice little pile of crispy traditional fries, sweet potato fries, and an onion ring or two was a real treat. I only wish there had been more onion rings in the mix. The iced tea was some kind of flavored tea, maybe pomegranate or something, and was also very tasty. The service was superb - my glass was never empty (a BIGGIE to me) and the server was very friendly but not fake. I will definitely be back!\n",

Not in the I'm on my way to becoming an alcoholic kinda way, but in the I want to dry a different beer each time I go out kinda way.  That being said, this was a great place to do that.  We were looking for somewhere to just grab a quick bite to eat before we headed to the airport and this was a great solution.  The food was easy (the generic menu that you'd expect--my burger was just okay) and there's plenty of grease to go around.  The service was fast and efficient, though not overly friendly.  The decor is exactly what you'd expect from a place like this--a bit loud with way too many televisions.  \n",

I went into this restaurant a little skeptical (desperate housewife star=good restaurant ??), but left extremely impressed.  Maybe we just got lucky, but everything we had, including our service was topnotch and excellent.  It's not cheap, but if your going to spurge, this is a great spot.  My wife had the regular fillet ($?) and I had the bone-in fillet ($50) and both were perfectly cooked to melt in your mouth.  I highly recommend the mushroom and truffle macaroni and cheese.  It's strange giving such a great review when so many people have not had a good experience, but our one experience here was awesome.  Maybe we just got lucky.\n",

      "Awesome family owned hole in the wall Vietnamese place near UNLV. Most people are probably iffy about going here just because it's in the sketchy shopping center with Von's because that sure did happen to me! However, do not let that stop you from trying the awesome food here. I always get the banh mi and I would have to say the grilled pork is my #1 pick while the grilled chicken is a close 2nd. The pho is also tasty and pretty standard compared to other pho places. My favorite would be the brisket, which is what I always get in my pho. I also took Jane K.'s recommendation of the grilled pork vermicelli and boy was she right! It was absolutely amazing. The flavors blend together so nicely and I also like the freshness of it. ORDER THIS! My mouth is watering just by writing this review. So if you have a hard time trying to decide what to order, my preference is grilled pork vermicelli, bahn mi and then pho. If you're ever hungry in the area Pho Thanh is a must try.  Only 4 stars because sometimes the service is just blah, but I think they're nice to me just because I come in so often.\n",

Everything I have tried so far including the appetizers and main course meals have been delicious and satisfying. My favorite so far is the curry dishes-coconut rice is a must try. I also like how there are vegetarian/vegan options at this restaurant. For quality Thai food this is the place to go PLUS they have excellent customer service to go along with it. Which is pivotal among this review.\n",

      "One of my very favorite places to eat in Las Vegas. This place is in Summerlin, about 15 miles off of the strip in a suburban neighborhood. If you are from out of town, go here, and then go to the Red Rock Casino across the street. There's more to Vegas than The Strip!\n",

The filet was awesome, very lean and made the way my wife wanted it.  The rib eye was outstanding, I ate the whole thing.  The armospher is relaxing and the service was second to none.

      "Best Italian fare in Pittsburgh. I have been eating their pizza and hoagies for 40+ years since it was Josephines. I have never had pizza its equal anywhere. Their restaurant is fabulous. We take groups of 6-8 and everyone is always very impressed. Never had a complaint except when they brought the wrong dish to one person once. You will need reservations on weekends. Wait staff seems overly busy at times. I have seen Ben Roethlisberger eating here with large groups (family?). They have guys park your car because their lot is small and there is not much on the street. You won't go wrong with anything you order at this place. You can bring your own wine but they have a corkage fee.\n",

      "I went here yesterday with my friends for the first time. The menu has such an extensive array of meats, sides, desserts, and even seafood options that we must've stared at it for 5 minutes. I ended up using the Yelp check-in offer after I found out that I can get a dessert with any sandwich - including the outstanding Outlaw Burger.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got to nibble on a few of my friends' items while sitting out the 15 min burger wait time. The beef rib was really good. I just might get a slab of those next time. The jalapeno coleslaw was also nice, but maybe a bit spicy for my delicate (read: wimpy) tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had a few burgers around town, and the Outlaw Burger is definitely up there. It's piled high with all kinds of goodies, including a surprise shrimp or two! They grind up their brisket into it, and while there's no trace of pink inside, it's still surprisingly tender and not dry. I did have some issues with huge chunks of meat falling out of the burger and into my tray, so I wish they would have made a more cohesive patty. Still, it was ridiculously good and something I would order again and again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I probably should have gone the traditional route and picked fries as the side in my combo, but I wanted to try the bacon potato salad. It definitely felt homemade and wasn't as oily as some renditions are. However, I didn't think the cold temperature worked very well with my hot burger, and I imagine all the other meats are hot as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "My visit wasn't a perfect experience. The biggest issue was that they told me they'd bring my peach cobbler out later on and they simply didn't do it. I take a while to enjoy my food, and I still had to walk back to the front podium afterward to remind them. But when I finally did get the cobbler, I was in heaven. It's a heavy, assertive dessert, and the portion is easily worth the $2.50 to tack onto your non-sandwich.\n",

In my most recent visit we were seated for 5 minutes before a server ever came over.  I had to ask for a beer menu.  They have over 100 beers, why don't they just give you a beer menu with the regular menu?  My beer was almost empty when our food arrived and I quickly finished it once I started eating.  I didn't see our server again until after I was finished eating then she asked me if I wanted another.  I told her no, just a check.  She said she would get it and bring my daughter her oreos.  After another 10 minutes went by we finally got the check and of course, no oreos.  Needless to say I won't be going back.\n",

I ordered a salad with shredded pork on top.  They received their meal and were half way done and I still did not receive my SALAD!  The waitress never came over to say anything or check on us.  I had to yell across the  restaurant to inquire about my salad.  When I asked she said oh, he's making it now!....very rude, I might add.  I told her that she can  just cancel my salad as my family was almost done with theirs.  I nibbled on my husbands greens and rib tips.  When the waitress finally brought over the check there were never any apologies on my salad, REALLY!!  I will never go there again!  You are suppose to offer a Groupon to get customers to keep coming, not scare them away...but maybe that is why we were treated like second class citizens!

On the other hand, our server was overattentive whenever he was at our table.  For instance, when we were ordering, after we placed our order he would offer commentary on each dish.  This might just be a pet peeve of mine, but if I've already decided on a dish, I don't need you to tell me that it appears small on the plate, but the filling and the reduction are actually quite rich, so I think you'll be satisfied.

The service was decent, we were seated immediately. The place was very busy, so I thought we were in for a winner. I had french toast and my Mom had biscuits and gravy. My french toast was less than mediocre - the bread was spongey.. My Mom's biscuits were absolutely awful, they tasted like they were made with some kind of chicken stock/boullion. The gravy was good. We let them know and they even said they were trying out a new recipe to replace the frozen biscuits they had been serving, but were having trouble perfecting it. They took it off the bill, which I was pleased about. I also felt like for what it was, they were extremely pricey. I've had better breakfast at Lenny's.\n",

Small town feel in a big city with a fast-food restaurant order elegance. If you don't like to cook your own scrambled eggs, this is a good option for you.

      "I've watched Emeril on the FoodNetwork Channel for years.. I even used to tape his shows through my VCR (yes VHS tapes). I have heard of this place through a friend that told me that everytime his brother goes to Vegas he eats here. So, when I found out that it was Emeril's Restaurant, I was even more eager to try this place! Well, I finally had the chance to experience this restaurant, whose owner is one of the most enthusiastic and giddy chef's around! \n",

      "I had made reservations a couple hours prior and when we got there we were seated within seconds. Place was pretty occupied with plenty of men dressed in suits, a few couples and  loud crowds that had their drunken voices echoing throughout the restaurant. All the staff members were well postured with every movement from pouring drinks to picking up finished plates off the table. The place is contemporary, a minimalist dream with large and very comfortable dining chairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The order:\n",
      "\n",
      "Vine-Ripened Tomato Salad: Tomatoes were juicy, plump and tasted so fresh. The tomatoes combined with the red onion, fresh mozzarella, extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar = 4.5/5 stars\n",
      "\n",
      "Lobster Bisque: Wow! I've had this dish a couple other times at other fancy restaurants and this one just blew those away! The flavor of the soup was smooth and had just the right amount of lobster flavor, not rich at all. Came with a few pieces of lobster.. what a tease! \n",
      "\n",
      "Potato Gratin: came in a mini pan with the whole top completely lightly crusted brown. I grabbed my fork, broke into the soft crust and scooped up bite with a little bit of everything on it (crust,  potato and cheese). One of the better potato side dishes I've ever had!\n",
      "\n",
      "Creamed Corn Gratinee: also came in a mini pan with a crumble/breaded top layer. The breading went well with the corn but overall it was just good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bone In Rib Steak: Server asked me if I wanted Emeril's Essence and slice of butter placed on my steak. I told him that I wanted it the way it should be served.. Shortly, the steak was finally served with a thin slice of butter with the evident Emeril Magic Dust BAM! sprinkled over  the meat. It was a healthy portion and did look Fantasteak! Not the softest steaks I've had but had a Nice Chew, not the juiciest but was far from dry, overall had a very well rounded quality to it. No Complaints! \n",
      "\n",
      "Emeril's Banana Cream Pie: Came Tall with layers whip cream, generous amount of banana slices, banana cream and thin crust. There was also chocolate sprinkled/shavings  on top and caramel spread on the bottom. A great way to finish a fine dinner! \n",

      "This place is in our neighborhood, but I would rather drive miles away to have better sushi. We got there at 3:05pm and saw their sign for Lunch All You Can Eat for $19.99 and confirmed the price with the waitress... we sat down and the waitress took our order. The sushi was pretty bad (I've had better from Smith's deli) and our bill was for $55! She said since we got there 5 minutes after lunch that we were charged for the dinner price. It was our fault for not asking, but she should have mentioned it when we ordered.\n",

      "I really wish this place was here when I was in UNLV.  This would have been a great compliment to the Aloha Kitchen right across the street from it.  I had never had Yoshinoya before but someone at work told me they were big in Cali, it's kind of like Japanese home cooking.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got around to finally visiting one night.  Wow, not bad at all!  I know, for the low prices you shouldn't expect 5 star gourmet cuisine but for what it was it wasn't bad at all.  It really got me wishin' this place was here when I was in college.  Imagine all the drunken nights, then getting a nice bowl to satisfy the munchies?  It would have been great I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place isn't the cleanest of places (check the bathroom) but at least the dining room is clean right before a late night food rush.  You see where I'm getting?  This place is popular with the college folk!  In case you didn't know, Yoshinoya serves Japanese food bowls, almost like ramen but instead with rice and meat.  Their claim to fame is the 'Yoshinoya Beef Bowl'.  But they've added chicken since opening its doors back in California.\n",
      "\n",
      "I LOVE the chicken and beef combo bowl (around $7).  It's got steamed rice on the bottom and is topped with their teriyaki chicken, fatty sliced beef (so yum! It's like the beef in sukiyaki), and a veggie mix (broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, cabbage).  Their sauce makes it soooo good!  This hits the spot when you need a quick meal.  I almost forgot, you get a drink with the combo, and a side dish as well!  You can choose from a green salad, macaroni salad, soup, caramel flan, cheesecake, strawberry cheesecake or cookies.  So many choices!  I usually end up getting the green salad because on the desserts they actually include the nutritional info, leaving me feeling a little guilty.  If you eat in, on your table you have the choice of soy sauce, seasoning, and pickled ginger.  All you can eat pickled ginger!  I love the stuff and I eat a buttload of it with my meal every time.  It goes well with the sweet sauce of the dishes.  Prices for everything else are very reasonable and the food is filling.  I can get away with spending less than $20 for my gf and I, and we get entree, drink and side of salad or dessert.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The customer service was friendly, even when they were busy with lots of college students.  Umm...half drunk college students...*tear* oh the memories!  They were completing orders quickly because it wasn't too hard to assemble one of their bowls or combos.  My only gripe here is that they serve Pepsi instead of COKE, ugh.  Boo.  I can't stand Pepsi.  I was born in Georgia....go Coke!  Coke is it!\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you're a college student at UNLV, lucky you.  Yoshinoya has a special college meal, I think it's a beef bowl and a drink...all for $2.99!  But you gotta show your UNLV ID to get it.  No wonder the place was full of students that night.  Sure beats having to go to the DC (Dining Commons to you UNLV folk, Deadly Cuisine to my old college pal...ha ha) and figuring out what you're eating.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yeah, one last tip.  DO NOT save this stuff for leftovers the next day...it can be NASTY!  I think it could be the soggy rice.  It just doesn't taste right unless you eat it the same day you buy it.  Or maybe I added WAY too much ginger?  Anyway, just make sure you eat it all or throw away what you got left.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But try this place if you're near UNLV and in a pinch for something to eat.  If you're not in the In-N-Out mood, give Yoshinoya a shot.  It's good, filling food.  Just don't blame me for a sore tummy if you eat your leftovers the next day!\n",

It kind of takes the fun out of being able to find a great lunch deal and just lumps it in with all the other lunch places.   Given also that Chinese food is incredibly cost-efficient to make, it's a shame.  They should have cut costs with all the extra stuff they provide you with - designed ornate lunch paper bag, special containers for the food, etc.\n",

One was served flaming and the other from a special pipe from the Czech Republic.  The somolier was uber-knowledgable and made the experience fun and interesting.  That said, the meal was as good as anything in LA or NYC.  There are dishes for the gourmet and options for the not-so-adventurous.  That's a good thing because I am the former and my wife is the latter.  Fois Gras brulee with brioche is not to be missed!  I also had veal cheeks.  Awesome steaks, chicken, fish are also on the menu.  Desserts are individual works of art.\n",

      "After days of junking it up w/ fried foods in Sin City, I needed something light and green in my life. I ordered a vegan Buffalo Chicken wrap. The wrap was large (I could only eat 1/2 of it) and it came with a simple green (think super greens) salad with a balsamic dressing. The wrap was mostly shredded lettuce, but it also had a fair share of the soy chicken, and the buffalo sauce (comes on the side) was yum! It was good, and it was just what I needed. The next time I'm in Vegas I will go back to try some of their other vegan food options.\n",

      "1- Hot Fudge Sundae Cake: I don't know if I should say anything, because I don't want to ruin the surprise for anyone. The icings were reminiscent of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, it had a chocolate ganache (the hot fudge), sprinkles, vanilla cake, and a surprise filling inside, which made me want to do back flips. So rich, I could only take 1 bite.\n",

      "2- Strawberry Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cake: a chocolate cake, chocolate icing, strawberry, a chocolate chip cookie piece on top, and the surprise chocolate chip cookie dough in the middle.

      "Made a reservation for my first time trying this place.  Wanted to go have a nice dinner with my boyfriend for our date night.  Arrived early and was extremely underwhelmed with the decor/interior.  The hostess immediately explained that due to a large walk in party, I would not be able to be seated on time.  She then walked me to the bar and said when our servers are available, then we will seat you at a table.  OK.... so we sit at the bar and order martinis- which were very overpriced considering this is in a strip mall OFF the strip ($13) We sit and wait for over 20 minutes before deciding that this is ridiculous and discuss where we should go instead since we wanted to catch a show we already bought tickets for.  The bartender overhears, and then grabs the hostess and she tries to convince us to stay, but then promises that our food WON'T be ready in time for our movie.... but we should stay anyway.  What a joke.  Horrible first impression, unimpressive service, and overpriced.  I will NOT be giving them a second chance.\n",

It was clearly discrimination against a person who's of Hispanic descent. Totally inappropriate, and such a disappointment to the good time I was trying to show my kids.

      "Also had a strawberry croissant on the side. Looks like a halfed plain croissant with some sort of strawberry chunky perserves smeared inside, topped with a crumble and possibly baked. Well...it was HEAVEN. Just the right flaky crunchiness around the edges and once you bite into the softness of the strwaberries and inside of the croissant melt in your mouth. Cafe mocha was Delish too!\n",

They had my favorite beer on draft (which I can't get in CT where I live) so I had to get one, even though it was lunch on a Tuesday. :)  Compared to pints in the Northeast, $3 felt like a steal!  The bartender was friendly and fast with service.\n",

We went around 430 on a Tuesday and made reservations.  Wasn't 100% filled! but close.  Make reservations anyway. The only two negatives I can think of is obviously the price.  It's worth what you pay, but slightly high.  Second, if you don't like noise, get table away from the fountain.

We were going to another breakfast place in the DC Marketplace but the wait was over 30 minutes, so we decided to head over to Herb Box.  I have heard so many good things about Herb Box's brunch and I am so glad we went because it was the best brunch I have had in a long time! \n",

I couldn't decide between the cinnamon pancakes or the bourbon peach French toast and asked our waitress which was better. She told me that the French toast was definitely a favorite and was almost sold out for the day. I jumped on that and was so glad I did. \n",

My husband enjoyed his mango lemonade but I thought it was a little watered down.\n",

It was both heavy and light at the same time and the flavors were outstanding. I didn't even need the maple syrup they serve alongside it - the bourbon did an excellent job. It came with bacon and the bacon was crispy and delicious. Shannon enjoyed her pancakes and I tried a bite. It was truly like eating cake - super moist and chocolaty. My husband enjoyed his omelet and I agreed it was delicious. The Brussels, manchego and pancetta really blended well together. \n",

Don't think I'd order those again, but the salad was definitely great.  It was a nice way to enjoy the bbq withough getting all weighed down with the heavy stuff.\n",

      "Been here a total of 3 times now.  As they say, three strikes and you're out!  Verona Chophouse is definitely OUT after my third visit for dinner last night!  I'm sad to say that, but 2 bad visits of 3 visits ends in NO WAY will I return again.  So, as a frequent visitor to Lone Butte Casino and Wild Horse Pass, they are kind enough to give me perks to come back to the casino (imagine that!).  One of the perks I get each month is $100 or so to spend on restaurants/food in the casino.  So, my fiancee and I decided to head out to Verona Chophouse a few different times, which I'll summarize here with the approx dates and experience we had on the 3 visits.  \n",

      "1st visit - Went for dinner.  Food was so-so.  Service was horrible (soooo slow) and atmosphere was nothing to comment on.\n",
      "\n",
      "2nd visit - June 2011  Food was REALLY good.  Had the filet mignon and my fiancee had the chicken parm.  Both were tasty.  The filet was juicy and soooo tender.  Chicken parm was a large portion and delicious.  Service was better than 1st visit (not spectacular, but not bad...) and we were given new hope that this could be a great place for us to eat, near home.  Also, there was a piano player and a singer there for a great ambience.\n",
      "\n",
      "3rd visit - Aug 2011  Went at 6PM and asked for a table for two.  Was told by the hostess that there was a 20 min wait.  No problem.  More gambling!  We came back 20 min later and were quickly seated, with the hostess telling us the waitress was REALLY busy delivering some food and other things and would be a few min.  About 5 minutes later, while reviewing the menu, the water/buser guy comes by to ask what we want to drink and tells us the waitress is delayed and very busy.  Next up the manager comes by to tell us the same thing.  Um, now we are getting worried and looking around to discover how there was a 20 min wait when the place is empty??!  There were a total of 8 tables with customers and the rest empty.  We chalked it up to it must be they don't have enough servers.  We finally meet our poor waitress.  She was a bit on edge and stressed and I kinda felt bad for her.  At a few times I actually saw her RUNNING through the restaurant to get to the back and run a credit card, pick up food, etc.  So, we ordered fried mozzarella and crab stuffed mushrooms as appetizers.  I ordered the filet again because the 2nd visit here it was so yummy!  My fiancee ordered penne pasta with chicken and broccoli, but asked for no broccoli.  We wait about 10 min and then our waitress comes by to ask if we want our salads first because the mushrooms take longer to cook.  We said that's fine and so shortly after that, we got our salads (I had the house salad, fiancee had the ceasar).  Both salads were pretty tasty and probably the best part of the meal.  Appetizers come out 10-15 min later.  The mushrooms were not fully cooked and were nothing special.  I really think they were frozen pre-bought from Costco that they baked in the oven.  My fiancee said the fried mozzarella tasted like fish, but I didn't taste any, so not sure.  Maybe they used a fish fryer for them?  Waiting..waiting...waiting for food.  Meanwhile, another table of 2 gets seated in our waitresses section.  She keeps walking by to serve them and telling us that it will be just a little longer as they are waiting on the filet.  About 10 min later (now about an hour into dinner...way too long for this dead place!) our food entrees arrive.  Looks like my fiancees meal is the wrong order and she confirms it is!  She did admit it was her own error and she put in the wrong order.  So now he's left returning his entree to wait another 10+ minutes for the correct entree.  Meanwhile, I'm anxiously awaiting my first bit of filet.  Blech.  It was overcharred on one side (which the chef hid by placing that side on the plate so you couldn't see it!) and had no flavor.  The broccolini was cold and what were supposed to be potato fingerlings appeared to be rocks.  Seriously.  Now she brings out the correct entree for my fiancee.  We know that the check is going to take 30 min for her to produce, given our experience thus far, so we ask for the check and tell her we are using the casino vouchers I get, as a perk.  She comes back about 10 min later and says she needs to check on something with the vouchers and should just be a minute.  10 more min later the manager (who was doing NOTHING but yelling at everyone during this whole dining experience...shouldn't she be running food and actually helping them??!!) came by to see if we needed anything.  Luckily, we didn't answer what we wanted to say!!  Told her we needed the vouchers done so we could leave.  Said it will be just another min.  The waitress returns 3-4 min later and says we're good to go.  THANK GAWD!! \n",
      "\n",
      "So, third time was not a charm and neither is Verona Chophouse.  Even if it's FREE (like our meal was) it's not worth the time or effort!  Keep gambling but don't eat here.\n",

If not for the groupon we purchased we would've never came here. Free chips with salsa and bean dip. I ordered the shrimp and steak fajitas. Hubby had the shrimp tacos. It was a huge platter of food. Lots of peppers and tomatoes along with my steak and shrimp. We were only given 2 tortillas so I asked for more. Didn't know they were going to charge for more tortillas. Hubby's meal was super small so luckily mine was big so I could share with him. Both of our meals came with rice and refried beans. I do not eat beans and they were mixed on the plate with my rice. Our total came out to $12 which included the groupon discount. So once was enough for this place. Too many other restaurants with better service.\n",

They have a nice patio area where you can sit back, relax, people watch and enjoy some humdrum food. Only complaint-random, crazy people screaming about Jesus and the noise from the Gold Rush and other CATS buses. Last time I went, our server was very sweet but it took almost 30 minutes for our lunch to make it out. I ordered a chicken sandwich and french fries-were they killing the chicken in the back?? I kept watching servers go by with other peoples food, practically salivating over the plates of french fries since I gave it up for Lent and just wanted one fry to make me happy.

      "Have gone here for years, through several owners and the food has been great almost every time. Once in a while they get really skimpy on the portions or seem to lower the quality of the ingredients (change of management? ownership?) but maybe people back off and they realize it and return to the good stuff; not sure. Food is great, prices are decent, portions are generous. Staff is hit or miss and usually hanging out with friends or regulars, making it hard to get attention sometimes, but it's part of the atmosphere. In reference to the take-out comments below, we've begun to do that more only because we can't stand the hookah smoke (sorry hookah peeps!) but that fruit smoke does not mix well with food. They'd be well served to create an outdoor area for the smokers and the non-smokers - especially since cigarette smokers join in as well. Unfortunately, the huge indoor area they have is weird and gross, which is probably why there's never anyone in there. All that said, the food here is good so it's definitely worth trying.\n",

      "The food was good, the service was average. The real reason I am writing this review is because of the management. After eating there last night I looked over my bank statement and noticed an additional charge aside from what I paid for my meals and my drinks, and not it wasn't the tip. It was almost $50 that had been charged to my debit card of food and drink I did not order. Well obviously I was surprised and somewhat irritated, so I gave them a call. I asked to speak to a manager and held for no longer than three minutes while someone went to get him. Sean, the manager on duty, was extremely polite and efficient. He asked about the problem and immediately took action. He put the money back on my card and all was taken care of within minutes. He even told me to ask for him the next time I was in and he would give me an appetizer on the house. I was pleasantly surprised at how easily and quickly he resolved the issue and was impressed with his customer service. Kudos to Sean at Icehouse in the South End.\n",

      "I liked the fact if you stayed, they brought your food to your table. The layout is very similar to a fast food burger or sub joint. our order came out in about 10 minutes.

I have to say that I enjoyed the look and vibe of this old school, romantic, mobster-ish joint a tad more than I enjoyed the actual food.

Delicious hamburgers, shakes and fries. Fast service even with a line. And a Target nearby for us to gather necessities for our trip. A great way to begin our National Parks adventure.\n",

      "Okada is known to have freshest sushi in town...I wouldn't know if its THE freshest sushi, but it definitely ranks up there as one of the best  in taste, texture and overall gastronomic experience. The Hamachi with Chili Salsa and Ponzu sauce was good enough to order - Twice! Order the Seaweed and Cucumber Salad topped with the snow crab. The flavor of the crab adds flair the salad. The Mushroom salad has a rich smokey taste and was a nice change from the run of the mill Portobello mushroom that you find in most restaurants. The Foie Gras was good - not great. The pairing with the Unagi didn't do much for me. The signature Okada roll - I could've done without... tastes mostly like mayonnaise, the only plus about the it was the 2 large lobster claws that accompanied the dish. \n",

Speaker for pickup doesnt work, u just have to hope they see u on camera or youll be waiting.. hannah had wrong price so i couldnt contact on speaker- had to run in cause i forgot my cell. They gave me correct price, and my order. I get back to my van n check my bags. Hannah had forgotten half my ordr. No cheese crisp, xtra chips n salsa, and my entire carne asada chimi meal with rice and beans were no where to be found. So now, im making my second trip in cause again, speaker doesnt work. Mind u, hannah has only been out to my vehicle once and that was to get my name for my order and my credit card. I had already given her a $10 tip for my $37 order when i paid.  AND ive gone in and out twice cause she didnt properly check my bags. I shoulda asked her for change since i paid her tip cash. By the time i got back to my vehicle, my initial food brought out first was cold. Hub and I, as much as we like the food, have now sworn off this place for good. Customr service on to go is zero stars the only reason for two stars is the cooks know what theyre doing. Let me make a point of saying I always tip good rght away and normally this gets me good srvice. I pay cash tip even if i use cc just so i know they get it right away, and recognize it...like i said, they appreciate the consideration normally and i get good service.  I'll know better next time i guess. I checked my bags, i made sure ordr and pricng on receipt was correct, i did all the legwork...shoulda tipped myself!\n",

The Stacy roll is shrimp tempura and cucumber with crab on the outside.  I thought my BF would like it because he doesn't eat raw stuff but he just thought it was so-so. The best part of the meal for me came next which was the Nabeyaki Udon. I was pretty impressed by their udon.  It came with a bunch of tempura, including two pieces of shrimp.  Inside the bowl was mushroom, tofu, onion, egg, chicken, and noodles.  Pretty good I have to say.  We also had the beef curry, which was a bit runny and bland.\n",

      "Location: It's like any other place on Central- the location itself isn't that sketchy but everything around it is. The inside is a pretty standard Mom-and-Pop simple decor. Dining area was pretty clean and employees were walking around regularly to make sure it stayed that way. Trashcans had those annoying small-circle opening tops on them and made discarding your refuse without getting crud from previously discarded trash on your hands a task. Men's bathroom was cramped but clean. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food: I had the brisket, pulled pork, and Cowbro' beans. Brisket was alright; I've had better and I've had worse. It could've used a bit more smoking/more intense smoking but the sauce complemented it well. Pulled pork was good- about on par with any other decent pulled pork. It had a nice balance of flavor between the meat and smoke and was also complemented well by the sauce. The sauce is a low-viscosity variety with a great balance of sweet and spicy. The sweetness was just enough to draw out some extra meaty flavors in the brisket and pork without overpowering it. The spiciness was just enough to complement the other flavors, keep the taste-buds excited, but not too spicy by any means. The Cowbro' beans were actually pretty amazing. They seemed like a standard canned-base with other seasonings added, which made them taste infinitely better than canned. The beans also had chunks of smoked sausage in them, which I felt was a nice touch. The sausage had good flavor and a crisp casing. \n",
      "\n",
      "My girlfriend had a pulled pork sandwich, ribs, and mac n' cheese. She thought the ribs were alright, a fairly standard rib. She enjoyed the mac n' cheese and was too full to touch the sandwich so it came home with us. \n",

      "My friend had the chicken sandwich, mac n' cheese, and peach cobbler. She thought the chicken sandwich tasted good but was a little dry (and it did look a bit dry from across the table).

      "Went there as an out-of-towner and really enjoyed my breakfast. I had the pork carnitas skillet and it was delicious. After being disappointed with the carnitas at an actual Mexican restaurant, I was quite impressed with that skillet. I also took the recommendation with regard to the fresh baked raisin toast, and that also held up to the recommendations listed here. I tried a bit of the bran muffin and that too was to die for. I cant think of anything negative to say about anything during our visit. We even had a little laugh at the check that says crakers copy at the bottom. I'd definitely return and recommend this place to anyone for a delicious breakfast.\n",

Not the most gentile environment for a serene cup of tea. \n",

And the way she described all of the items made me want to order one of everything. Also, she encouraged us to take our time. We started with an app, hung out and talked, then ordered an entree, hung out and marinated on that, and then ended with dessert. We were there for quite some time and never felt rushed or abandoned.

The pretzels have just the right amount of sea salt (not too much) and are so fantastically soft. The fondue was the perfect temperature and they have a little candle flame to keep it the right consistency so you can take your time eating. Although those pretzels disappeared really fast. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our entree, the sweet corn cannelloni. Thanks to Tori warning me this is seasonal and will change to butternut squash I was all over it. My friend and I split this and the serving size was still plentiful. I want to find whomever came up with the idea of putting mashed corn inside the cannelloni pasta and kiss them on the lips. The butter sauce was so flavorful but not too heavy and complimented the corn flavor instead of distracting from it. \n",

      "Dessert. Words cannot describe. I have lived in a world where I believed the best dessert in existence was creme brulee with berries until last night. The salted caramel custard made me want to utter inappropriate noises of delight.

      "Rocco's is probably the best pizza you're going to find in the Aliante area of North Las Vegas. The slices are big, and they come somewhat close to resembling New York style. They expanded the small shop to include a dining room within the past year or so, so you can comfortably dine in here if you prefer. There are plenty of other options besides pizza (available by the slice), from hot Italian sandwiches to linguine with clam sauce. The pasta dishes are decent, priced a bit high, but the portions are quite large for one person. They also have gelato, which you're probably not going to find too many places around the area. The service is very friendly, alcohol available.\n",

The fillet mignon was great; grilled exactly how I liked it -- medium rare.  I personally enjoyed the rib-eye only because the cut was more tender.

It's much more pleasurable to watch from the inside of the restaurant rather than standing with the crowd of tourists outside! :) I enjoyed the romantic ambiance of the restaurant -- quiet, dimmed lights and tables covered in white table cloths with candles lit on the table. There was a photographer that came around each table to take pictures; she even showed us how to pose for the camera! Now, THAT was definitely a first experience in a restaurant!

However, the crepe itself was thicker than I expected - I would say it was more like a hotcake.  However, they also have hotcakes and pancakes, so I'm assuming hotcakes are even thicker (or greasier, since the Pamela's ones are).  The thing that I loved about the meal was that it was not greasy.  Pamela's is too greasy for me; it makes me feel like I just chugged a bottle of oil by the time I finish the meal.  Also, the ricotta cheese inside the crepe was amazing.  It was creamy, and went really well to balance out the sweetness of Nutella and chocolate chips.  Overall, this is possibly the best crepe I have ever had.\n",

      "Me and my girl went here last night for dinner and I had heard good things but was not sure what I was in for. To my surprise when i stepped in through the large copper doors I was amazed. This is a very nice place to eat. It challenges any top tier steakhouse in the phoenix area and in my opinion beats them. The reason is the value of the menu. You get great cornbread and biscuits, a relish plate soup or salad and a side of your choice included in the price. Mastros, Mortons and all the other greats are ala carte, and here its all included, and honestly i felt like i got a better steak. I went with the prime rib dubbed best of the west and they were right. It was one of if not the best I ever had. My sweetheat had the combo oscar which had a small peice of salmon and a filet. Everything was cooked to perfection, the oscar sauce was delicious..so were the soups and salads. Service was over the top and even though it was my first time there, i felt like a regular. Would I go back...you better believe it. \n",

      "This place seemed to attract an older crowd, but it was very nice and classy.I can't understand why it  was not more crowed than it was. After eating there i feel obligated to spread the word.

      "Wasn't impressed by the food here but the owners were very friendly. My bf got the red curry with shrimp and I got the chicken pad Thai along with some wontons. The wontons weren't very good and the dipping sauce looks weird. The pad thai was not very good. It's easily my favorite thai dish so I'm no stranger to the dish and this was a let down. The chicken tasted kind of questionable. On the other hand the red curry was very yummy. Inside is very plain, more of a takeout place. The prices were pretty typical for takeout.\n",

I'm not normally much of a fish eater, but it was so good I ended up having the catfish the second night as well, along with the brisket. The meats were perfectly cooked and so smoky and juicy that you really didn't need the sauces for either the flavor or moisture, although their sauces could have a review of their own. \n",

Black Dog's beans are the best I've had anywhere and I would go back just for the beans alone.   The smoky cornbread was exceptional, and the smoked sweet potato with just a touch of butter and brown sugar was amazing. \n",

It's clear they will stand out well on any of their sandwiches.  Tasted exactly like the large dill pickles you get at Disney, in case you need that for a reference.  The kicken' beans, lived up to their name and had some spice to them along with a good peppery flavor.  There were some shards of brisket added in for some smokey flavor.  I personally prefer sweeter southern baked beans, but for some reason those are hard to get outside of the south.  Bacon potato salad, could have had more bacon in it as I couldn't really find any in there.  I still enjoyed it and it had a texture of a smashed potato salad.  The clear star of the show was the mac 'n cheese.  Some of the best I've had, it's very cheesy and creamy.

      "First and foremost, this isn't classic Chicago Style pizza. With that said, the pizza still isn't bad. Of course I think Girodano's, Malnati's, Gino's is all trash so take this as you will. I've been to this place three times now and I will say after my first visit (lunch buffet) was so so as far as i'm concerned. The salad was good though and who doesn't like a warm cookie as you leave? This led my wife and I to try it for dinner one evening. It was busy, around a 20 min wait for a table but it was worth it. We were given a bar table which allowed me scan the numerous brands of beer on tap-lots of micro brews which is great. We ordered the Chicago Style medium (plenty for three) and it came with plenty of cheese and lots of flavorful slightly spicy sauce. The crust was crispy yet tender inside, my preference. At any rate the service was prompt and competent. Overall I believe we'll definitely be heading back to this place as long as the beer keeps flowing and the pizza quality is up to snuff.\n",

Lots of protein options which were all pretty tasty, except the lamb and chicken were quite dry. Their house salad was wonderful.  Service was pretty good.

      "This is my 3rd bad experience at this location. First we were there for a hour and no food, and the manager came to our table and gave us a coupon for our meal. The 2nd time one of our two steak was under cooked, so we paid for one and keep the coupon. The 3rd time again we had an under cooked steak and that's when the customer service was trouble. First the manager took half off my steak then after we complained they took the rest off. We tried to use the coupon to pay for the other steak, which was half of the coupon amount. They refused to give us another coupon for the remaining amount. So then we tried to use the remaining amount for a friends meal and they refused. Needless to say we will not going back to this location, because of the awful customer services. As a steakhouse, you would think they know how to cook a med steak.\n",

      "The Princess and I have been huge fans of Flo's for years, since the original Flo's next to Osco on TPPW before they moved across the street.  This location is our local favorite and try to get over from the NW Valley at least once a month. The Saturday $5 lunch special is truly the best lunch value in the value. I really admire her business acumen for recognizing the need to pack her place during the economic downturn, provide excellent jobs, and still make good money on volume rather than GM%, but I digress.  If the food wasn't good, it still wouldn't be worth $5 and it is.  We love the food and especially the generous discounts during happy hour.  My favorite on the menu is the house chow mein with shrimp, chicken, and beef-extra spice. It is one of my all-time favorite things to eat.  The Princess always gets the spicy ginger beef, kind of a play on mongolian beef, it's excellent as well.  Make sure you get the salad with their amazing, one of a kind ginger dressing, you'll want to take some home (and yes they will sell you a container of it).  Hat's off to Flo's!

We ordered the 4 cheese Nacho platter (we have a vegetarian in the group) and asked them to add black beans, which they charge extra for! The nachos come out with very little pico de gallo, and literally a sprinkle of black beans. The good thing was the waiter came out with a bowl of more black beans b/c he realized how very little we were given (so yes A for service). \n",

A bit salty but the chicken and pasta was cooked perfectly. It was a huge serving - more than enough to share and take extras home. The pizza was cheese, sausage, onion and pepperoni.

So are the crispy little tacos.  I haven't ventured too far out of the box, pretty much sticking with tacos, burritos, and chimis.  Its just something about the heftines of the chimi that you can't help but smile about.  Service continues to be friendly.

Stopped in the other day to grab a few things and ended up with a Greenman IPA and a grilled pimento cheese sandwich w/ tomato and bacon. I think it was 1:30pm on a Thursday. Yep, I don't normally drink a brew with lunch but something about this place just says go ahead, no judgment here. I'm glad I did. The sandwich was fantastic. Nice, crunchy sourdough bread and warm creamy pimento cheese. This place is also a plus for people watching!! See you soon!\n",

      "My mother always said to me If you don't have anything nice to say,then you should not say it. Well sorry Mom ,not going to happen this time.  I joined some old friends for dinner at Don and Charlies at the recommendation of my friend's family. To be fair I am a foodie,so this might seem a little harsh.  . The first thing I received when I walked into the place was the smell of mold mixed with some industrial cleaner,probably the most pleasant  aroma that I had throughout the evening and of course the duct tape all over the old carpet was quite attractive..My server  informed us that she had worked there for 30 years..Wow. Unfortunately for her time here she couldn't answer  our questions very well. We asked about the  so-called Prime beef ,if that actually meant Prime Grade  Beef  she seemed dumbfounded and if it was wet or dry aged.Also inquired what was in the rice pilaf ( vegies,stock etc) still no definitive answer,what size were the shrimp . We were not trying to harass the server we  have some  dietary needs and we were trying to  get some entrees and appetizers  that we could all share.We decide on  the chopped liver,the rib appetizer and a couple of wedge salads,caesar,and a french onion soup to begin followed by salmon,New York ,prime Rib,BBq cicken,Bone in Rib eye and ,halibut. The ribs were not very meaty and extremely tough  probably the worst that I have ever had,,french onion tasted like knorr beef stock and liver..and we all love pate, was quite frankly disgusting. The steaks were ok but not prime grade the salmon was previously frozen  farm raised Atlantic salmon the deli cole slaw was decent the creamy tasted ok but exactly like the Colonel's The BBq chicken was gross.,Halibut was so-so. All and all  my review of the place would be outdated cuisine prepared without skill or love but with the same price points as high end steakhouses in the area. The place just looks old and tacky with ripped chairs, old smelly carpet,.crud stuck beneath the tables and servers who  are as antiquated as the establishment..Comfort food? Only if you are comfortable with ghetto crap food . Sorry Charlie (and Don)\n",

      "Would you like to know how to truly embarrass yourself in front of a staff who has been nothing but friendly, professional, and helpful?  Leave without paying your tab!  Ooops, one too many cask beers.  Actually, it was probably all the bourbon... Anyway, the nice bartender chased me down through the Venetian, and a $30 tip later, all's well that ends well.  I came here to kill some time waiting for my husband and a few friends who were attending a conference.  I wanted to eat everything on the menu, but contented myself (no, actually gorged) on their poutine.  Oh, dirty, dirty poutine.  It's salty, so you'll need a beer to wash that goodness down.  By all means, get a cask beer.  While less carbonated and warmer than tap beer, you'll taste and appreciate more complexity in the cask beer.  I'll be back in a few weeks for a Pappy Van Winkle.  And this time, I promise to pay for it :)\n",

      "Yet another SF snob, frequently disappointed by food on the road. The restaurant was recommended by the hotel which made me skeptical. All in all good service and food, a solid 4 star. I was intrigued by the large metal fish when I walked into the restaurant. I like a place with expression. My co-worker thought it looked junky. The blackened ahi tuna special was nicely presented and good complement of flavours with the lobster mashed potatoes. My critical co-worker had the crabs cakes and thought they should have chunks of crab in them. I tasted them and tended to agree that they needed a little more. The wine list was good with a Chalk Hill cab. After dinner Jim, the owner, came over and started talking with us about wine. He was quite knowledgeable with an extensive wine list.\n",

I had the spaghetti with garlic lemon butter and shrimp. I ate the whole thing (which I never do! I couldn't stop!). BF had one of the Valentine's Day specials, a linguine with red sauce and shrimp. He really liked it. The bread was very good, too. It came to the table hot and crusty, and they had some great flavored olive oil for dipping.

I could absolutely not tell that there were any additional spices or sauce on my burger, and yet I paid an additional dollar. When I told the server I thought I had gotten a hula burger by accident, he actually said, No, it's a Cajun burger, you just can't tate the difference. I've been telling the kitchen staff that forever but they don't believe me. ?????\n",

      "This review is for Brio Tuscan Grille's happy hour, but frankly, considering how poorly happy hour went, I'm never coming back here to try their lunch or dinner. I wanted to try a new happy hour and had heard good things about Brio's food. I took my sister with me to try it out and off we went.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the first thing happened, I knew I should have just turned back around and tried another restaurant at Town Square. What happened? There were three employees up at the front of the restaurant chatting with each other and when we entered, I said two for happy hour. The guy said happy hour hour was on the patio and turned back to chatting with his fellow employees. I had never been to Brio before and wasn't sure how to get to the patio. Did he want me to go outside to gain access? Through the restaurant? His arm gesture wasn't too exact. So I asked how to get there, trying to subtly convey Could you walk us there? but nope. The guy just kept arm gesturing and said to sit out on the patio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fine. We walk through the restaurant and exit out a door to the patio. We see an empty table and sit down to wait for a waiter. Five minutes or so later, a harried waiter comes by and asks if we were seated by the front. I said no, we were here for happy hour and the guy up front just told us to sit out on the patio. Apparently the real tables were not meant for people during happy hour and that the couches by the fire pit was designated for happy hour. Uh, that was not mentioned, and this time I flat out asked if the waiter could show us this area. He did and I have to say, the area for happy hour sucked. The tables were made out of some flimsy material (some kind of flexible wood? I don't know) and the chairs/couches were terrible for eating on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The waiter said he didn't know which waiter was going to serve us, but he would find out. I thought that was strange, but didn't think much of it. Again, another thing that should have made me just walk out with my sister and try another restaurant at Town Square instead. He came back and said he was our waiter and the entire time, he was just twitchy, like he didn't want to serve us. I guess it's because we were doing happy hour and by default, happy hour customers' bills won't be as high as someone just having dinner? Which is a stupid reason but one I kept leaning towards the longer we stayed at Brio.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a vodka martini which reads on the menu Sobieski Vodka your way: Dirty or Dry with an Olive or Twist. When I ordered it, however, the waiter never gave me an option on how I wanted the martini. When it was served to me, I took a sip and nearly spat it out. It tasted terrible. If it wasn't for the fact that I paid for alcohol, I would have just set it aside, but I finished it because I paid for it and I wasn't going to waste it (but I definitely wasn't happy drinking something I didn't like).\n",
      "\n",
      "As for happy hour food, we ordered tomato margherita flatbread, brio burger, and crispy cheese ravioli to share between us. The order took awhile to get to us and when it arrived, the burger was cold and the chips on top of it were stale. It was a dish I thought my sister would enjoy the most because it's a burger, but she refused to eat it after one bite. Instead she ate most of the ravioli. The flatbread was okay, just okay, but it's not something I'd want to pay for.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a disappointing meal and happy hour (sad hour), I asked the waiter as he passed by for the check. I wanted to leave and wash away this disappointment. It took him awhile to hand me my bill and then it took even longer for him to return with my credit card. At that point my disappointment slipped into frustration. Why the heck would a restaurant have a happy hour if they don't want to have a happy hour? Because that's how it felt like. The seating for happy hour was terrible, the staff was terrible, the customer service was certainly terrible, and whether they were short staffed or not, don't act like you don't want me there because I'm going for happy hour and not expensive dinner prices.\n",

It was juicy, and bright, and meaty, and perfect.\n",

      "You know what's cool about this spot? They don't play the typical world beat tabla bullshit that's played in most Indian restaurants. They play jazz. And I don't mean smooth jazz, I mean Coltrane and Miles Davis jazz. The food is not traditional Indian, but fresh and tasty nonetheless. Good parathas, samosas (obviously), garlic naan, vege biryani, salted lassis, fantastic okra, and really fresh tasting saag paneer. They also sell mason jars of homemade chutney, which are pricey but the chili chutney is surprisingly hot and flavorful. By far the best place for vegetarian Indian food in Vegas. Now, for the less desirable aspects of this spot... I am almost positive that they use MSG as a flavor enhancer in their food (a farley typical practice in Indian cuisine), because I invariably end up with a headache/nausea after eating here. The owners, a married couple, aren't terribly friendly, and the dead pan husband can be downright alienating at times. I would recommend this place as a nice take out spot with the caveat that if you are sensitive to MSG you may want to avoid altogether.\n",

      "Horrible. Just plain horrible. Like the other review, get one star cause I have to. Ordered a small chili with cheese. Asked for some chili sauce packets on the side. A spicy chicken sandwich combo with a side of ranch. The wifey was nice enough to get it in the first place, so I can't complain to her. No ranch. No chili sauce. No spoon to eat the chili. No straw for the drink. No napkins to wipe hands with. Did get ketchup for the fries, but didn't eat them because they were colder than the ice in my drink. I was soooooo angry I actually called. The manager offered to give me the stuff if I drove down and pick up the items. There was no mention of a refund or a gift card for a future order. Doesn't matter because I won't be going back.\n",

      "We were told that this was a good place to go with our 2 kids.  We arrived at 5:45 on a saturday evening, and they were slammed.  The service was slow, I am pretty sure our waitress had WAY too many tables.  I got the bacon blue burger and it was good, although they overcooked, I asked for medium and it was well.  My husband liked his southwestern wrap, until he picked up the second half and discovered a hair on the plate.  Once our waitress returned she immediately took it away and asked him if he wanted anything else, but at that point he lost his appetite.  They did take the $ off the bill.  It took our waitress at least 10 minutes to bring the check once we asked for it, then we paid partly with cash and partly with a card.  We instructed that she take the cash off the bill and put the rest on the card, she returns, cash gone, and full amount on the bill.  Now we stand around another 10 minutes waiting for her to return.  Finally get it all taken care of and get out of there. Definitely not someplace I would recommend or return to.  Maybe it is better during the week when they aren't as busy?\n",

The reviews on Yelp were good and I was told by a fellow steak lover that if I wanted a great (not the best) cut of steak at a reasonable price, then Texaz is the place to go.  I went on a Thursday evening and the place was pretty busy.  I was seated right away by a very friendly hostess.  You could tell from the looks of the place that it had been around a while.  I could have sworn my booth was going to fall apart, but it was ok.  The décor is a bit eccentric with anything and everything having to do with Texas all over the walls.  All the patrons seemed to be having a good time and enjoying their meals.  There were also plenty of wait staff bustling around.\n",

However, it was a bit odd because it contained diced green olives (which I normally don't like), but I said what the heck and ate it all anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised.  When the steak arrived I was surprised again at the size.  I was expecting it to be much smaller but it was a pretty big cut.  I'm guessing around 8-10oz.  I love it when steaks are cooked in plenty of butter (gross to some people...I know) and I guess this place knew that because there was plenty of the hot, melty goodness all over the steak and plate!  It was soooo good but soooo unhealthy.  It was cooked perfectly and I ate every bite.  The potatoes were just ok but I ate them anyway.  Nothing a bunch of salt and ketchup couldn't fix.

Boy, was I wrong! Since I'm not a fan of peeling shrimps and breaking off the head, I decided to order calamari. I love calamari, so I was looking forward to them; specially after a four hour drive. Unfortunately, my taste buds went through an awful experience. The calamari looked pale, texture was soggy, and undercook! How in the world can you mess up something that goes in the fryer?! Second, the batter had no seasoning and it tasted plain. I was so disappointed, because I really wanted to like this place. However, our waitress was very accommodating and apologized; although, it wasn't her fault. The waitress offered to comp my food and asked if I wanted to order something different. I was very pleased with her customer service, but said no after getting something raw. I was afraid of food poisoning; specially, since I'm in Vegas. \n",

The chicken nuggets are not fresh, but frozen, and they taste like they've been in their fridge for weeks. So, parents beware when you take your children to this restaurant. Also, if you're the type of person that likes to wait till everyone is served, your food will definitely get cold here. They don't bring all the entrees at the same time, but what ever comes out faster from the kitchen. I was the last one to be served, so you can only imagine how much I was looking forward to their calamari. Those of you who like different type of hot sauces for your oysters, they only carry Tabasco sauce. I wouldn't recommend this place, but you be the judge!\n",

The servers are friendly, and the owner makes a point of genuinely getting to know you.  The beef tips are one of my favorites.   Great slaw and of course they are famous for their fried squash.\n",

      "Let's talk about the good things at Moto.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Beer. The owner (who splits his time between CO and AZ) doesn't mess around with typical beers. You won't find Budweiser, Miller, Coors, Heineken, Corona or any of their lite varieties. Usual beers found on tap are from Four Peaks (local brewery), Stone Brewing (San Diego), Avery Brewing (Boulder, CO) and various other craft brewing companies. \n",
      "\n",
      "Along with the beer comes an in-frequent beer celebration held at Moto. This happens for Stone Brewing Anniversaries along with other random events. Usually advertised on tables a few weeks prior to the event. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Non-sushi menu items. There is a good selection of pre-made bowls along with a make your own bowl option. I consider all of these bowls to be to-go options, I can never finish a full bowl (I'm 6'3 and 200+ lbs, to give you an idea of my size/appetite). Also, the buffalo burger and salmon entrees are good sized and won't break the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've had every appetizer available on the menu and can say that they are all good to excellent. The spring rolls come with a wonderful sweet sauce. The chicken quesadillas are large and filling. The asian nachos are piled high.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Desert - The Mojos are probably one of the best frozen deserts I've ever had. Ice cream wrapped in rice crispy treats. The ice cream can change daily, the servers usually do not know what flavor it will be. The menu states this as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The Underground menu. This is the menu of specialty rolls that are made. These clock in at $12 each and are very good. The Jalapenko is spicy and very filling for an 8 piece serving. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The all you can eat on Saturday. This is both good and bad. The good is that yes, you can get all you can eat (of the available sushi, not everything is on this special). The bad is that once it gets busy you will need to wait for your items, Moto runs two sushi chefs max. If you expect 20 orders of 5+ sushi items to come out in 5-10 minutes, you need to come back to reality. Get there early and order in a timely manner, be prepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And now the downside:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Sushi - The regular menu has, in comparison to other sushi bars, a very small selection. As mentioned in earlier reviews, only smoked salmon for some items rather than regular salmon. The sushi available is of good size without the rice bloat that some sushi bars have, you know what I mean, when the roll has more rice than contents (fish/veggies/seaweed or soy wrap). I recommend ordering a regular roll, such as spicy tuna and an underground roll (mentioned above).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Wait time and servers - This is a neighborhood restaurant, through and through this is how the owner markets the establishment and runs it. If it is very busy you will need to wait for a table. You will need to wait for your order to be prepared longer if it is busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That's all I have to offer you in the way of advice and opinion on Moto. Overall it is above average when factoring in the experience and goal of the restaurant. I wouldn't call it a sushi experience, but rather a nice sushi restaurant in a good neighborhood. Go to have a nice lunch or dinner, or to watch a game and drink some great beers.\n",

      "I first read about this place in the Phoenix New Times and I take my wife there on occasion. We like coming here for dessert, after eating somewhere else. Their take on banana cream pie is exquisite. But it seems with every time we give this eatery our patronage, the service gets worse and worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cork's version of banana cream pie is awesome. Elegant and tasty. But having a meal here is a different story, and after only trying the food one time, I won't ever do it again. \n",
      "\n",
      "The one time my wife and I ordered food from Cork, it was only out of curiosity and was following meal at another place; thus we only wanted something light before ordering the banana cream pie, so we each got an appetizer. I got the plate of meat, cheese, and crackers; and she got a salad. Both dishes were lean on the helpings, and though I've come to just expect it from Cork, I find the portions a bit annoying for what you pay. (I've seen what other patrons order as well, and see the cost on the menu. Geez.) Anyway, my appetizer was good for what it was, and the wife was satisfied with hers as far as taste went. But the turn-off was with the waiter through the entire time. First, he acted very irritated when we only ordered water and not wine, and was very condescending with us wanting only appetizers to precede our pie. (Usually people order a MEAL with an appetizer. WTF?) The kicker was when he made snarky comments about me paying cash instead of using my card. What, dude? When I have $35 in my pocket, is the place really too ritzy to pay the check with cash? That was a new one.\n",
      "\n",
      "If my review were based solely on what our personal Cork staple is (the banana cream pie,) then it'd get 5 stars. But between the minimalist yet expensive portions and the up-nosed, elitist attitude of our waiter, I just can't give it even an average rating. From now on, we only come to Cork for dessert.

I ordered the carne asada meal, and I have to say that the service was quick and the food was inexpensive. The meal I got, though, was a disappointment. The beef was very dry and tasteless and the rice was dried out, although the refried beans and the soft corn tortillas were OK. Overall, the meal was unsatisfying and I left quite a bit of the meal unfinished. I may try the place again some day as this may have been an off day for the restaurant, but for now I'll have to give it 2 stars.\n",

I start looking at the 20+ big screens all around me and not one has the game on. I walked up to the manager and pointed out the fact and he said he'd see what he could do.

The place has great decor, and experimental food. A tad to trendy for scottsdale, even though scottsdale has wealthy people. L repeated with her sons on her own. So, if she takes her sons there on her own, it gets her stamp of approval.\n",

      "service was friendly, and prompt. Drinks were large and free refills, which I really appreciated. But as far as the food goes it was pretty average. I agree with some other reviewers who stated that the sauces seem watery, and the veggies seem canned. i had the yellow curry chicken. it's flavor was acceptable, but certainly not the best I've had. HOT was the spice level I requested, but disappointingly the spice level AND the food temp were somewhere around luke warm.\n",

      "Burger with tasty smoky grilled flavor and choice of toppings. May order different weight patties. Really enjoyed the crispy outside, soft inside fat fries (similar to steak fries). Theskinny fries tasted like McD's if you prefer. The lemonade was made from real lemons with pulp in the tart and sweet drink. Only negative was the price (reason for 4 rather than 5 stars), but this Fatburger is on the Las Vegas Strip, so bet less expensive at other sites.\n",

      "Emeril's style of cheffery is considered by many young chefs these days to be lazy and outdated. Though he probably was, at some point, an inspiration to most of them (they'll never admit it), his generation's approach to food and cooking seems to be a dying artform.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there's something refreshing to his laissez faire, rustic kind of cooking. It's less scientific and more feel. Less sous vide and more pan roasted. This is what I was looking for when I dined here.\n",

      "Unfortunately, the experience mostly seemed hackneyed and lazy. \n",

      "The server was...well...weird. I couldn't quite read him. Maybe he was new. Either way, he did a satisfactory job and was at least friendly. \n",
      "\n",
      "We started with the chilled seafood platter. I was excited because the menu said the shrimp and lobster was creole boiled and that there was king crab remoulade. And though, the shrimp and lobster were fresh and delicious, the were certainly no creole spices to be found anywhere. Not to sound like an elitist, but I lived in Louisiana for 8 years and have eaten lots of creole boiled whatnot and there was no spice at all in this seafood...and barely any flavor. (Ok, I guess I'm an elitist...sue me!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Second course we received the gumbo and the barbequed shrimp. The former was rich and smokey, full of flavor and decidedly lukewarm. The other complaint about the gumbo is the homemade andouille: super garlicky...overwhelmingly so and whatever spices were in there weren't ground up enough because I was crunching on some stuff every other bite. The shrimp were superb. This is a classic Emeril dish that always delivers. I will say I would prefer a crustier, sturdier type of bread to serve with the dish. The rosemary biscuits, while fantastic, crumble when trying to dip into that beautifully rich and flavorful sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the main course, we split the grilled salmon with barbeque sauce, frizzled onions and brabant potato hash with tomatoes and andouille. Fresh fish, perfectly cooked to medium, yet a bit overwhelming. Lots of flavor doesn't always translate to balanced flavor. There was a lot going on in this dish and again, the homemade andouille just kind of overpowered my palate (not to mention my GI tract. I think I burped garlic for about a week).\n",
      "\n",
      "The dessert was decent. We ordered the trio with bread pudding, banana cream pie and chocolatey something-or-other. The chocolatey-something-or-other was (obviously) not memorable. The banana cream pie was UBER rich but tasted good. The bread pudding was definitely the best part. \n",

      "The one reason I can't give them 5 stars is because they lack the variety that other buffets have.  They have more variety now than the first time I went (around 3 years ago), but I can see some people wanting more.  For example, they had 2 types of salad the day I went: caesar, and smoked salmon.  They had a few other dressings (bleu cheese, italian, and something else), and both salads were great, but sometimes you want to build your own salad with all sorts of additions that the Wynn lacked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The few soups that were served were very interesting (I think one was a pumpkin soup), but I didn't see anyone get them!  I think they were a little too different, and they should stick to normal.  A few years ago they had this amazing cream of asparagus soup, I was sad they didn't have that this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prime rib was amazing, spicy tuna hand roll was very, very good, and the cheese ravioli was the best pasta even though it was the simplest.  I can't remember much more, but those were the standouts.  I was really disappointed in their mashed potatoes and other sides/veggies... strange thing to say, but I expect better, especially after Bellagio's pesto mashed potatoes!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the dessert is what SHOULD get the Wynn 5 stars!  Homemade ice cream and sorbet that truly rivals Haagen Daaz, Dreyers, and any other famous ice cream maker.  Amazing bread pudding, creme brulee, cookies, madeleines, etc.  I definitely enjoyed my dessert more than the dinner, and I'm not usually a big dessert person.\n",

All four of us ordered the 4 course tasting menu with wine pairing. I started with the smoked salmon appetizer followed by clam chowder, striped bass and the carrot and peas dessert which was actually carrot flavored ice cream topped with a cream cheese whipped cream. Each course was delicious and supplemented with several additional courses from the chef. \n",

I have done my grocery shopping at Mercado's.  I've had many a drunken, reckless, eat till you burst and drink till you puke night in baja.  I have smuggled fireworks and Cuban, or what I was told were, Cuban cigars across the border and yes, I have most likely eaten dog or donkey tacos in Tijuana.

      "My quest for good humble Mexican food in the Vegas valley has been 3 years in the making and time after time I have been disappointed.  This place however was good.  It was not bad but it was not out of this world fantastic.  I ordered a shrimp ceviche tostada 3 tacos, one carne asada, one al pastor, and one lengua to get a full range of flavors.  The lengua was pretty damn good moist, tender and flavorful, the same goes for the pastor it had good flavor, good texture and the taste was pretty impressive.

It was VERY crowded, which I usually wouldn't have too much of a problem with, except people were rude, pushy, and mildly violent. The music was pretty good, although I only knew half the songs.

      "I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants, even upscale ones like the Yard House. However, I am a fan of the Yard House, and here's why: First, the beer selection; if you're a fan of craft beers like I am, you will appreciate the dozens of craft beer offerings, many of which I have never tried. The Bear Republic IPA was my favorite of the night. Second, the menu is interesting and the food flavorful. I had egg rolls and lettuce wraps; both were in Asian-fusion style and wonderfully flavored. Third, though some reviewers have complained about price, for Monday Night Football they have all-night happy hour, with half-priced beer, appetizers and pizza. You can order appetizers and eat Tapas style while you watch the game from a large number of big screens. With beers, my bill was only $25. Lastly, the service was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and quick.

From the moment I walked in the door the girl that noticed me walk in jumped up and came on over..gave me a couple options of where I wanted to sit, I chose to sit at the bar.  They set me up with a tasty sweet tea right away.  Delicious it was.  My waitress was attentively awaiting my order, but in no way pushy.  She was busy at the time I closed my menu, but someone else was right there and asked me if they could start something cooking for me.  By all means they could.

      "*Food:  Good, plenty, and quality.  I had a pretty good plate of food in front of me for $8 (of course, not counting drink or tip).  Chicken seasoning/batter was quite tasty.  My only nit here is that the chicken was a little dry.  It did fall off the bone...but was just a little dry.  The sweet tea and excess syrup on the plate were excellent for addressing this issue though.  Plus, some chicken and waffle bites together was actually not bad.  The waffle itself was quite fluffy and quality made.  My only nitpick with the waffle is aside from the butter provided, the waffle itself had a very buttery flavor to it.  There was nothing wrong with it...just wasn't quite expecting it...and it didn't seem that the syrup was very sweet...so it just tasted very buttery (if I'd realized that, I probably would not have used the whole dollop of butter that was there).

I declined...but I must say...I really, really enjoyed the customer attention and service.  So many places lack this.  It was a delight and a pleasure to patronize LoLo's Chicken and Waffles.\n",

      "We were back in the Concord area and decided to give Sticky Fingers another try. To the establishment's credit, several of the problems (dried-out BBQ and slow service) we experienced during our initial visit did not recur. That and moderated expectations made for a much more enjoyable meal.\n",

      "Sticky Fingers was out of brisket when we visited, so my companion and I opted for a sausage/BBQ combo plate and an order of BBQ tacos, respectively. First, the good: all of the meats were moist, and the sausage had both a wonderful smoky aroma and a savory black pepper kick. The seasoned fries were also above-average. Now the bad: neither the pulled pork nor the pulled chicken had any discernable seasoning. Generous application of the house sauces (there are several, ranging from smoky to hot to sweet) and taco fixings remedied this, but one would expect smokehouse meats to be imbued with more flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was both friendly and prompt during this visit. While the $8 lunch specials weren't being offered, the $9 to $10.50 blue plate specials came in generous enough portions to justify the pricing. The brick-and-pipe decor remains a good fit for the cuisine, and there was plenty of seating.\n",

My friend and I split a quiche and their pomegranate and pineapple pancake--both of which were extremely filling and delicious. The quiche was light and fluffy, and the onions, bacon, and herbs complimented each other well. The pancake turned out to be more like a crepe and was not overly sweet.  My favorite part of the meal was the pineapples which were sautéed in what tasted like brown butter.  The service was excellent and we didn't have to wait long for a table.\n",

      "Good salad bar and unlimited fairly decent quality steak of all different cuts. Some cuts are definitely better than others though, so be sure to pace yourself and start with really thin small portions so you can figure out your preferred cut and then attack. Avoid eating too much bread or at the salad bar, as there's only so much food that can fit in your stomach. The place will be noisy and hectic as waiters are flying all over the place slicing steaks for people. I do not recommend coming here on a first date or for a special occasion or if you just want to be intimate.\n",

      "Yum, yum, yum! The food is beyond delicious and oh-so-flavorful. I take a bite of pizza, or a bite of salad, and it's like there is a party in my mouth! I'm not a foodie, so it's difficult for me to describe the food. But I can tell you it's tasty and fresh. I think I like the salads the most of all. Service is friendly and warm. And the atmosphere is so slick and sleek. Whoever did the interior design did an impeccable job. However, it's not overly fancy either, so feel free to dress in jeans. Due Forni is quite chic, without being snooty.\n",

      "Teds is a good place to go with friends. They grill all of your food fresh in front of you, and have a cool way of cutting up the dogs as they're cooking. I wasn't a fan of their white hots, however I can't fault them, as I've never had them before. I may just hate veal! Their regular hot dogs and brats are spot on, and tasty. The onion rings are hand made, and are also pretty tasty. If you do stop by, make sure to get a chocolate milk shake. It's one of the best in the valley (trust me, i'm fat!).\n",
      "The service is not amazing, better than McDonalds, and not as personal as a sit down restaurant. They're definitely trained to get you through the line as quickly as possible.\n",

      "I've been here three times now, and have zero complaints about the food. People are right when they say the chicken noodle soup here is amazing! When I've come for lunch I've ordered half a sandwich and soup - the portions are huge! It's a great value. The waiter always seems to recommend Challah bread, so that is what I've gotten and it has been really good. Also, I had some sort of brisket eggs benedict - again, the portions are huge, I think I took almost half of it home. And the brisket was very tasty and tender - exactly what you'd expect from a delicatessen. \n",
      "\n",
      "The downside is that there can be a wait and they don't seem to keep a list. You just have to stand around at the door until they get to you. And people aren't really standing in a straight line because there is limited space. It would make things much easier if they just took down names and let people wait outside. (I guess you could always order your food at the take out counter.)\n",

      "Rocco's sure looks like a NYC pizza joint.  Partial brick façade, pictures of old-time Italian New Yorkers strewn on walls, abrupt but not necessarily rude employees, and display plates of each dish laid out behind the plexi-glass counter, all work out to a great facsimile of what you find in the City.  Huge plus for me, even the New York-style service.  I've spent many a months in the city that never sleeps and have eaten my share of New York style pizza, which is one of my favorite dish of all time.  I'd have to say that pizza here is basically the same as what you will get in a typical pizza joint on any street corner in the City.  And that's a good thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a slice of pepperoni and a slice of pepperoni/sausage, with a fountain drink.  $9.50 for that, which is NOT like NYC.  You can get that for $2-3 cheaper out there, so it's not necessarily a great bargain.  First bite into the pepperoni and the bottom is a bit crunchier than I'd like.  The end crust is a bit crispier than I'd like also.  Pep/Sausage is better on both fronts, but I like the taste of the pep better.  The sauce is typical, not great but not bad either.  It comes piping hot after they reheat in the pizza oven, so be careful you don't burn your mouth.  I did.  They also have stromboli and calzone, both of which I'd like to try one day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like I said, it's really not any different than the typical street corner pizza joint with solid pies, awesome setting, and take-it-or-leave-it service.  So does that deserve a 4 or 5-star rating?  Well, the level of pizza is probably a 3.5 based on a 4-star for the actual typical NYC pie, and obviously service is somewhere around 3.  But with the authentic setting and the fact that this real NYC shop is a mile from my house, I'm upping it to a 4 even with the inflated pricing.  But seriously, $3.50 is too much for a slice, Rocco.\n",

Also, i noticed that the cook attempted to cut the cantaloupe into pieces but stopped midway.. what the hell was that?\n",

This would have been a 5 rating, but note the following: our waitress was nowhere to be found (bus boy came to start our order after 15 mins of just sitting around), the free seasoned popcorn was over seasoned (careful when you munch down, the powder may make you cough) & the onion rings and sweet potato fries are average (pass on these if you're thinking about ordering extra). Now they are known for their burgers. I have not a negative thing to say, they are delicious and highly recommended.\n",

      "What a disappointment...the most over-priced, terrible dining experience I've had in Charlotte. Took 15 minutes to have drink orders taken. After that, the poor performance continued. The calamari was way over-salted!!! Awful. The sushi was sub-par at best. The fish was pretty fresh, but the rolls were simplistic and lacked flavor. Considering the specialty rolls range from 10-22 dollars, I expected a lot more. Ru San's is a much better choice if you are looking for sushi. The only good thing about the meal was that our waiter had the calamari removed from the bill because he agreed that it was way too salty as he had seen the chef season it. Even with that off the bill, way over-priced! Save yourself the time and do not dine here. The staff and customers at Enso are too worried about being hip to provide a decent experience.\n",

How on earth did they manage to pull that off?  We had large containers of the regular and spicy bbq sauce.  Good thing I loaded up on the spicy.  It wasn't.  At all.

Clearly this guy was an angry ole queen. They refused to honor my groupon, I was so pissed I just got up and left.  Normally I would have ripped the rude  ole queen working the bar a new one, but it was his lucky night.  Never go here unless you want to be treated like dirt.  I see lots of other 1 star reviews regarding how rude the servers are.  Then for the owner to respond with zero professionalism proves my point.  Anyone reading his response won't dine here ever!  He's the 100% scum he refers to customers as.  I wasn't trying to eat for free, I worked in a high end restaurant in college and tip very well.

It was just food, but I live to eat, and this was eat to live food. The sliders on the happy hour special had an akward taste.. The chopped salad was the best thing, bc the earth did all the work. My French onion soup was definitly too hot to eat for 30 min, and it wasn't in my top 20..

Waitress (who will go nameless) was not the friendliest - pretty unattentive to be honest.  The food runners spent more time at our table.  Drinks are less than generous pours to say the least, but the ice cubes are huge so they have that going for themselves! Food was decent nothing to rave about. The ceasar salad was the worst ceasar salad I ever had - terrible, flavorless, I can do much better at home - I've had better ceasar salad a big weddings.  I would opt for the brussel sprout salad next time.  Kind of sad when the most memorable moment of the night was the salted chocolate chip cookie on the way out - nice touch.  I may go back but won't be in a hurry to do so.  Service was slow.\n",

The number of selections is a bit small but that allows them to keep everything fresh and hot.  The dishes tend toward fried items and thus the one star reduction.  Don't get me wrong...I love me all sorts of fried anything.  Also, their fried appetizers and main dishes are crispy and not at all greasy.  I just would like a couple more healthy selections to balance things out a little. \n",

      "This restaurant opened in late June. They are predicting a Grand Opening in late September - early October, when their liquor license  is granted. I spoke with the owner and she is very excited about her new venture and knowledgeable about the restaurant industry. Her family operates several dining establishments around the Valley. They currently have indoor dining, but will add outdoor dining and entertainment soon.  The place has a nice feel; the atmosphere, service, and ambiance are very pleasant and inviting. There menu is nice; they serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I had the Philly and my wife ordered a Chicken Sandwich. Both were really good - four out of five stars. The Arizona Tots, instead of french fries, were delish! Prices are average for the area. This place has a great deal of potential and should do well.\n",

      "Porktropolis is Saucy! For July 4th, we ordered a precooked pig from Porktropolis. When we picked up the pig, the guys were super helpful and friendly. They walked us through everything we needed to do to keep the pig warm on the grill and pull the meat when we were ready to eat.  The pig included a selection of 4 sauces.  And, one thing I've learned about BBQ is how important sauces can be.  The apple BBQ sauce was top notch. It's sweet with a hot finish. The mustard BBQ sauce had good heat without having an overpowering 'mustardy' flavor.  I enjoyed these two sauces so much that I didn't take time to sample others. I'm anxious to try the other sauces they offer -- including the habanero sauce.\n",

I always have beef teriyaki at sushi places... since their chicken for some reason is never white meat. It was more like steak though, not the beef I'm used to. I felt like I needed some A1 or bbq sauce...but you can never go wrong with miso soup- but it will never fill you up. So I woudn't recommend this place to people who don't like to eat raw flesh of fish that smell like the women's restroom. I'll give them this- tempura green tea ice cream- Amazing!

Loved the guac and the spiciness of the beans but I felt like there was a lot going on in the dish.  I ate every morsel, though.\n",

      "This place was such a throwback, I loved it! The interior atmosphere was adorable, I felt like a little kid! Cute mural paintings too...I'm from Rhode Island where we take ice cream very seriously all year (despite temperatures a third of Scottsdale's) and this was good stuff. Wish they had more flavors though; the menu is expansive but in terms of actual ice cream and sauce flavor choices I was underwhelmed. That said, the hot fudge was amazing and a must!! Get the larger size sundae (I think it's called paradise? Apt, that.) because reasons. Finally: leave the cash tip at the table and then you pay at a counter on your way out, kind of like Denny's (I think. Is that a Denny's thing?) We only knew to do this from watching the couple at the next table over and our waitress not coming back with a bill- kinda confusing.\n",

      "The atmosphere - a bit noisy but it fits for Vegas.  The restaurant is in a cluster of all the restaurants at the Cosmopolitan and it's open to the lobby/gathering area.  It's a bit quirky and modern.  There's a foose ball table to sit at if you'd like although the stools looked uncomfortable for the meal.  Just a neat looking place.\n",

      "The service - spot on.  In a tapas restaurant sometimes things get lost in the mix since new dishes are coming out constantly, but not here.  Our waiter showed up right after we got settled and handed me the drink menu (in the form of an iPad which you can then order your drink on. Neat!)  Their staff is constantly refilling half empty water glasses, clearing the latest empty tapas plate and doing it all without getting in your way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food - The menu has a lot on it which is typical for tapas.  Since it was just the two of us we didn't try paella although I'd love to go back and get it.  We had just gotten back from Spain a few weeks prior so we wanted to see how their Jamon Iberico was and it did not disappoint, granted we got the most expensive one - Jamon Iberico de bellota Fermin which for 22 dollars is something you can fit in the palm of your hand.  But it's good!  Other favorite dishes:  the warm brussel sprout salad with apricots, apples and serrano ham which I found a similar recipe for online and it's almost as good.  Can't figure out what I'm missing.  Ensalata rusa which is proclaimed to be the ultimate spanish tapa and includes potato, mayo and tuna in a way I could never recreate.  We had other dishes and all were good but those were the stars.  For dessert, something everyone should try in their life.  Olive oil ice cream with grapefruit three ways.  This ice cream was the creamiest, most delicious ice cream and when you paired it with the tart grapefruit...unreal.  Try it.  Seriously.\n",

      "Okay, let me first say I love Pita Jungle. However, the most recent experience was about a C+/-. My friend and I went there to grab a quick lunch during the week, the place was pretty busy and we were informed that there would be about a 10 minute wait. Not a problem. So we went to sit in the booth towards the back of the restaurant. We were soon offered drinks while we waited, so we ordered a couple of iced teas. (A+ service there! So happy when waiting clients aren't overlooked!) So we waited for about 10 minutes and then were showed to our seats...then we waited...and waited...and waited. About 15 minutes later, the server came to take our order, we ordered an appetizer and two entrees....15 minutes goes by and my friend asks if they can also bring cucumbers for the appetizer when it comes out, server says 'No problem'...another 10 minutes goes by and finally our hummus comes out. No extra cucumbers, but by this point we are ready to gnaw off our fingers. With one scoop of hummus left on the saucer, the guy comes out with cucumbers, but my friend says disregard, as there is no longer anything to dip them in...then another 20 minutes goes by and the server comes up to the table to let us know our entrees will be out soon...then another 10 minutes...(for those paying attention, we have been at the restaurant for about an hour and 20 minutes or so) and finally our entrees come out. I ordered a gyro, she ordered the roasted veggie salad. Her salad was good, my gyro was cold. However, since I am more or less working with about 60 minutes for a lunch HOUR, there is no time to even mention it. No matter, the gyro was tasty (even though it wasn't warm). Two hours for a gyro and some hummus is a little extreme.\n",

      "I took the BF here for his first Taco Tuesday at Gallo.  After declaring the carne asada tacos best, I proceed to order only one carne and stupidly ordered a halibut and a shrimp.  #1 carne, #2 pork, #3 shrimp, #4 halibut.  After the carne, nothing else really matches up flavor wise.  The tacos are extremely small, street size, which makes me happy as I have a fondness for cute little things.  3 is perfect for me with an app and cocktails.  The guac, although small in portion size, is very good and I am a picky guac eater.  It has little bits of orange in it, which keeps me interested.  We also ordered the shrimp ceviche which is among the best I have ever had.  This will be a regular at my table from now on.  I would be remiss by leaving out the fact that the amazing salsa is served in squeezey bottles on the table, so I can pile my tacos and chips with the extra fantastical red sauce that I crave.  The last Tuesday I went, they had watermelon aqua fresca which I spiked with vodka and it was a little slice of heaven on a hot summer night.  The BF likes him some scotch and they had a brand to his liking.  We topped it off with the tres leches cake.  Omg.  Need I say more?\n",

      "Probably one of the most disappointing points of the meal (which isn't saying much), is that they only offered 4 side dishes.  Three types of kimchee: cabbage, radish, and cucumber.  In addition they offered sliced pickled daikon (radish) as well.  The cabbage kimchee was so delicious, perfectly chilled and with the perfect ripeness, you'll have a hard time finding this anywhere else!

(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VmVTDmlLZdwoRVTJO4niaQ?select=YCev16DPeJdZm8RRj9MU6Q) The noodles were firm and the bits of diced onions and meat mixed with the black bean sauce delivered an amazing feeling of comfort.

Located 20 mins from the Strip, the taste is as good as it gets in LV hotel's fine restaurants and the price is very agreeable. My boyfriend and I had the $55 pre-fixed menu, which includes appetizer, entree and a dessert. (If you don't want a dessert you can substitute it by choosing ANOTHER appetizer. What a deal.) I did a research on Yelp and picked BBQ Shrimps, Salmon Tartar, and sea scallops as the appetizers, and Roasted Lamb and Flank Steak on duck (as a nightly special) as entree and we had trio of sorbet as our dessert.

The salad was nice and refreshing but the sandwich was a little too heavy for me especially with the Vegas heat. \n",

I totally recommend it if you're a chocolate lover like myself.\n",

      "I give this Pinks Hot dog 3 Stars it doesn't compare to the one in LA, but it still OK and it does have that snap when you bite in to it. But it just doesn't feel the same as the one in Cali. It located at Planet Hollywood, they only have outdoor seating which is OK, but the inside is very small and doesn't have all the choice they have in LA. I try the Planet Hollywood dog and it was good. I think I just like the old school hot dog place that I had in Vegas. It true the original is always better.\n",

      "I'm not usually a huge Southern Indian food fan (I prefer the Northern fare), but my mum has taken me to pretty much every Indian restaurant in the greater Phoenix area and she wanted to try this one, so my brother and I tagged along (who says no to free Indian food? Who?). Food was awesome! Mum started off with the Mulligatawny soup, which was very spicy but really good, and my brother and I just ordered an extra side of bread (we always go with traditional garlic naan and we ordered an aloo peas paratha as well, which was very good). Mum had a dosai, which she is really fond of, for the life of me I cannot remember what my brother ordered, and I had the aloo mutter, which was fantastic. Our waiter was very nice and very helpful - a little too helpful, as he asked about the spice level we'd like (I said very low, as I know how spicy some places can get) and when Mum said an 8 out of 10 he replied, No, for you, a 3. He was mostly joking but she was insisting she wanted it very hot and he kept trying to navigate her down. He probably saw her as a delusional white woman who would start crying the second she started eating and realized how hot it really was, but she grew up in India and ate nothing but Indian food in London in college, so she (unlike my pathetic palette) can handle some CRAZY spicy food, and he eventually gave up trying to change her mind. We had a really great dinner, and it was nice to see that they actually have a lot of Indian customers, which usually points to some authentic and delicious food. Will definitely be back, this place changed my mind about Southern Indian cuisine!\n",

      "We visited chompies nearly every Sunday for 5 years. The food for us was really good until about 2 years ago, the quality started going down hill, I imagine it was due to the economy. We still went religiously, even though the food was hit or miss. About 4 months ago we went and I had the worst experience of my life. I ordered my usual, the eggs benny with smoked salmon... when they dish was brought out i could smell the fish, i knew it wasn't fresh. After arguing with the waitress she took it back and brought me a new one, which still smelled aweful, I took a few bites and couldn't finish it. 45 minutes later i experience the worst food poisoning of my life... I called to let them know to not use that fish, no idea if the message got to the kitchen... emailed them a complaint and never heard a word. All hope is not lost though! we found a new local breakfast place that we love, so maybe it is for the better. You will be missed Chompies....\n",

I read up on it and was really intrigued by the history behind the place and how this might be one of the oldest restaurants in Phoenix (they must be doing something right, yeah?) as well as being the only thing standing from the city's historic Chinatown.

As much as I'm into dives, this is a little bit higher than a place I ate called Won Kok which I am convinced is the butthole of Los Angeles' Chinatown. To be honest, all I that had at Sing High was the chow mein and the wonton soup. The wonton soup was just old cabbage boiled in water and the chow mein was just a plate of oily noodles.

All dressed up in our theater finery, we didn't much feel like fast food and the thought came to mind that we had never tried Gordon Biersch on Paradise and it always looked inviting from the outside so we thought, why not?\n",

Admittedly, they were not busy at that hour but still, it was nice being attended to so politely and with such courtesy.  Our server came over moments after we were seated and introduced himself to us.  Being that it was our first time there, he went over the menu with us and based on our feedback, made some recommendations for beverage and food.  I ordered one of their craft beers and my sweetie had a glass of wine.  Both were very nice.  For dinner, I ordered the Jambalaya and wifey the Chicken Pasta.  OMG!  Both were so good!  Her Chicken Pasta was full of flavor and my Jambalaya had just the right amount of bad in it to be wonderful.  Oh, and the desserts?  You know how so many places bring you way too much after a full meal?  Well here, they offer Mini Dessert Tasters, giving you just a few bites to finish off your meal, leaving a sweet taste in your mouth.  \n",

      "Very delicious and hearty tofu soup super close to the Vegas strip!  My friends and I were skeptical at first because the restaurant was pretty empty (granted we came around 5/6pm, so, pretty early I guess).  It also took us a long time to get our appetizers (almost to the point where we weren't sure if they served them there or not), but we realized that they were pretty short-staffed and the guy waiting on us and others was also the one prepping the sides as well.\n",

      "With the sort of long wait for food and empty restaurant aside... food was delicious!  The tofu soup was so rich in flavor (I ordered spicy kimchi beef, might've actually been too spicy.. ended up getting gastritis a couple days later! -___-).  One of my friends ordered the seafood tofu soup, which was packed with baby clams and shrimp, thumbs up on not skimping!  \n",

Maybe hitting them at a slow hour was what did it.  There is a little retail spot where you can get incense (they're hippies, get it???) and posters on the wall to peruse while waiting.  I took mine home, but the patio is lovely.  There's even a vintage bike parked out front with little baskets filled with potted plants.  How adorable is that????\n",

My second visit was much better, however I think our waiter must have been high on drugs.  During my second visit my friend and I ordered the fried manchego cheese appetizer and it arrived after our main entree.  Really???  I wish this place would get it's act together.  I'm very fearful in recommending Gallo to my friends and clients.  I've vowed to give Gallo one more shot and if it's not at least a good experience, I won't be back.

      "I am a big fan of sushi.  We were apartment hunting and one of the leasing agents told us about Oyshi Sushi.  We were glad we did.  It was a very refreshing change from our normal haunting place here in Silverado Ranch.  Oyshi is very nice.  Most of their patrons are young adults and they have pop music in the background.  We really liked the ambiance of the restaurant.  The best part was the food, for an AYCE dinner, it is somewhat on the pricey side but we wanted to try their extensive sushis.  They have hand rolls, cut sushi, baked, deep fried, fusion, vegetarian, specialty, and sashimi (this isn't included in the AYCE price though).  You can also have some appetizers and various salads, rice bowls, and dessert with the AYCE price.  For the two of us with regular drinks, we spent $61 ($71 with tip), so as you can see, it can get pricey.  \n",

      "3)  California Roll - they were done well as they should be.  It is a staple in any sushi place.\n",

I ordered a California scramble (eggs, tons of gooey cheese, diced chicken, tomato and avocado) with a side of fruit (berries, melons an grapes) and upgraded my pancake serving to their Wildberry one (pancakes with berry butter on top and more berries). It was enough food to feed me for the entire day and seriously caused me to slow down for the remainder of my morning, not to mention my dreaded Camelback hike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything tasted amazingly fresh and had tons of flavor. The scramble was the best I have ever had because the eggs were fluffy, they did not hold back on the cheese, the avocado was tender and the chicken was seasoned well. It was a decent portion and the side of pancakes was incredibly indulgent- using their home maple syrup and their berry butter. Jesus, my mouth is watering again just thinking about it.\n",

      "Our server was on point and always ready to refill our water carafes or coffee cups. I saw another table order some sort of latte/hot chocolate drink and I almost pointed and ordered it too because it looked freaking fantastic. My friend ordered the corned beef skillet topped with TONS of cheese, meat, BACON and hash potatoes- super tasty. Other friends got the protein pancakes (or as they called BROTEIN, cause they're douches like that) and they were a bit drier (because of the oats and grains added) but still well done.

Everything was very fresh and there was someone constantly checking on the freshness of the food.  I'd definitely go back!  PLUS the lunch buffet was only $7.99!\n",

      "I agree whole heartedly with previous posts... This place has been a total let down. Being a fan of hookah and late night dining, I really, really wanted to like Nu Sanctuary Lounge... but after 4 attempts, I have to say I'm DONE. The first night, we enjoyed the drinks and hookah but the server just a little rude and innatentive, nothing to keep us away. The second visit, the patio was full so we took a table inside. No big deal until after we received our drinks and were told we could not smoke inside for another hour... we waited 30 minutes for an outside table. Third visit for my sister's 21st b-day, we were sat at a table in the back with no acknowledgement for 20 minutes. The entire night if we wanted service, we waved our arms in the air until someone decided to stop taking shots behind the bar with the rest of the staff and serve us. In addition, the hookah was harsh, tasted bad, and the hookah girl refused to refresh it. Tonight was the last straw. We came in asking for a table on the patio. We expected a wait but to our suprise we were sat immediately. Three minutes after being sat, looking at the menu, we were told the table was reserved and we had to get up! Words cannot express how appaled I was!!! This was the las t chance. I was so excited for Nu Sanctuary Lounge to open but sad to say we will definitely not be returning and will advise everyone not to pour your hard-earned money into an establishment that does NOT appreciate your business!!! Everything I have experienced boils down to this- and you can tell immediately- VERY poorly managed. Someone had a great idea but completely failed at running their business.\n",

      "The benefits for coming to this place: Cheap prices and the perk of having the same price all you can eat for lunch and dinner! It is fairly cheap as well, definitely a plus! Our server was really nice but he was trying to make us order hot food instead of the expensive sushi stuff. He didn't stop us from ordering it but the way he insinuated it bothered me. Oh well, he was a small part of my meal, i enjoyed the food which was the most important thing. It only takes a few plates of food to eat your money's worth and i may have even made them lose money which means you really did eat a lot! Highly recommended!\n",

      "I'm going to come out and say it, the buffet isn't all that. It's certainly not worth it. At least not these days. Maybe back when it was new and all that, but like fish sitting out, the moment it gets old it's not worth eating and should be tossed out. \n",

Combined with the fact that if you need to use the bathroom, you have to walk thru the kitchen (against health code ew) I paid my ticket, because honestly, the girl waiting our table did not understand enough english to try to send it back ( or a sly move on her part), and we just left, into the sunset for good. the end.\n",

Their selection was a mile long, top quality taste, and attentive and quick drink refills. My only complaint was that their desert plates and ice cream bowls weren't replenished as promptly as I'd like, and ice cream toppings are limited to chocolate syrup and rainbow sprinkles. Overall though, you will enjoy this new member to the Surprise community!!!\n",

      "Okay the place itself is awesome and I'd give the building five stars... Where it goes downhill for me is the staff. When a few classmates and I  came for a few drinks after class we arrived and sat down at the bar. We ordered a few beers and then had to move to a bigger table to accommodate more people who were coming to join us. After we moved to a table close to the bar just big enough to accommodate all the members in our party a server came up to us and informed us that we were siting in HIS SECTION and he seemed annoyed to even be there. He continued to look at our table and roll his eyes at our already order drinks. Okay sir I totally understand the annoyance of guests moving around to different tables but in no case is it appropriate to give your customers attitude about moving to accommodate for a larger group of people especially on a slow night when there's plenty of tables open.

      "Service is excellent at this Grimaldi's; from waiters to bartender, you are treated with a smile. They would also make proper suggestions on if you trying to venture into exotic toppings area. They keep their pizza in the oven if you running late to pick it up, which keeps the pizza hot and fresh until you get home. This is the best way to do a takeout.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Food (5/5)\n",
      "This is the best pizzeria I've been to in Henderson or LV. I believe that this might be the best Grimaldi's location in NV. Every time I'm craving a pizza I come here to get my favorite custom pizza. I get their large pizza with marinara, pesto sauce (w/ olive oil), meatballs, and extra cheese. It usually lasts me for 2 days and tastes exactly same when you re-heat it the next day in an oven. Other item that I love to eat at this place is their caprese salad; it's fresh, flavourfull and light. Their cheese is not to chewy and it literally dissolved in your mouth. My mouth is watering just writing about it. \n",
      "Their desserts are excellent as well, I would highly recommend blueberry cheesecake. \n",

      "We had a window seat, which was fantastic- I did not ask for this but the staff were aware that it was my husband's birthday and I wonder if they put us there to make things extra-special! There was one weird incident when we were asked if another guest could share our table... we declined; it was awkward, but we still enjoyed the rest of our afternoon.\n",

      "The afternoon tea is a bit pricey at around $45/person but you get a lot of tasty treats and my pot was refilled (on request) at no additional charge. (At $12 a pot, if you skip the full afternoon tea spread, this could be a pretty economical way to enjoy a great view in a classy setting on the strip, sans alcohol.)\n",

      "They have a decent selection of basic teas; my husband went for a jasmine green and I had the Mandarin blend, which was black tea flavored subtly with (you guessed it) mandarin orange. The scones were delicious and so was the Devonshire cream and jam that accompanied them. We also had curry chicken, egg salad, black forest ham and smoked salmon sandwiches, as well as some very cute mini desserts (including my favorite, the sparkly purple macaron).\n",

The drinks are decently priced for the amount of alcohol that goes into them (they are strong!) but the food menu is somewhat small, this is definitely more of a lounge-type place than a dinner place in my opinion. Not a bad thing at all, just know that this is the kind of place to do drinks and appetizers versus a full blown meal.\n",

      "My co-worker and I each got a pizza which was enough to fill us and leave some leftovers (which re-heated very well the next day, so I basically got two meals out of it). The best thing we ordered was the breakfast pizza, topped with bacon, sausage, feta cheese, and egg. It sounded different so I had to do it and I was so happy I did, whether it was the best food choice to pair with the Manhattans I was drinking is up for debate but I didn't care too much....then again you could say the same thing about the way I dress most days too, so perhaps I am just being consistent?\n",

      "I ordered a chicken sandwich at this restaurant without mayo -- after waiting quite a while (I was one of two people in line), I finally received my sandwich. I checked the sandwich outside, just to be sure it had no mayo...it did. I returned, told the man who took my order (perhaps the owner?) that the sandwich had mayo -- he grabbed it from my hands, and gave it to one of his workers, who then came back with it about two minutes later. I thanked him and left. I again checked the sandwich when I got outside, and saw that the bread had been replaced, but mayo was still all over the chicken. I returned to the restaurant and told the man that it still had mayo, the man yelled at me and slammed the sandwich on the counter, insisting the sandwich did not have mayo. I showed him that mayo was still all over the chicken and asked for my money back -- a nicer man from the back of the restaurant thankfully came out and apologized and returned my money. \n",
